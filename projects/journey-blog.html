                        I am building two great explainers with design and code solutions alongside the Chrome team, the
                        auto-captions and cross origin storage (COS), not only that I am involved in testing them for
                        people with disabilities. This is where appreciation from Dirk Ginader (Google a11y lead) makes
                        me feel so proud.

                        When a Googler tells you, you're on the right path, means you are definitely doing a few things
                        right. One is becoming knowledgeable and being someone who can and already is providing value to
                        Google.

                        presentations on UX and a11y, and I am really glad they remembered. Hope to see them again at

                        my presentation
                        and asked for the slides, with a clear motive to introduce multi-modality in Chrome, and

                        developer advocacy book. Glad to have networked

                        The web store had the Badging and View Transitions API used with Progressive Enhancement which I
                        used for the feature request as well as making 3 videos on YouTube (Adam Argyle motivated me to

                    <p>Maintaining the web is important, and I have been documenting the Web APIs on MDN so future
                        developers are at ease at understanding concepts like DOMRect, DOMQuad, or the SVG API to name a
                        few. Creating new properties is important, and I have been making csswg drafts on W3C such as
                        the motion blur, progressive blur and directional blurs under CSS Filter API. Lastly, making
                        sure vendors are implementing those APIs is very important, that's why I lead impact based
                        approach, create good examples with stunning UX that solve real use cases and are radical, with
                        proper code documentation.

                        I recently worked on a use case for the contact Picker API is a time saver and helps in real
                        industry use cases, for us being able
                        to seamlessly send emails to multiple contacts at once to deliver orders at their addresses as
                        opposed to filling forms multiple times that gets tedious even with autofill. Furthermore the
                        user generally doesn't have address and names of others saved in their autofill so having a
                        Contact drawer to directly make all this happen is a game changer. For us retailers not on our
                        Stone Management system have been proven to get onboarded 70% faster by this API which has
                        potential to help million dollar businesses by reducing times.

                    <p>I became a graphic design volunteer for the biggest pokémon community. I also acted as a UXE
                        making a lot of amazing tools to ease the work of other designers, and taught them development
                        too! I love pokémon and
                        designing gave me an edge over other developers, having an eye for a design is very important
                        for frontend.</p>
