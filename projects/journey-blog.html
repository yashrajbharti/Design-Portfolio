                    <p>Maintaining the web is important, and I have been documenting the Web APIs on MDN so future
                        developers are at ease at understanding concepts like DOMRect, DOMQuad, or the SVG API to name a
                        few. Creating new properties is important, and I have been making csswg drafts on W3C such as
                        the motion blur, progressive blur and directional blurs under CSS Filter API. Lastly, making
                        sure vendors are implementing those APIs is very important, that's why I lead impact based
                        approach, create good examples with stunning UX that solve real use cases and are radical, with
                        proper code documentation.
                        <br><br>
                        I recently worked on a use case for the contact Picker API is a time saver and helps in real
                        industry use cases, for us being able
                        to seamlessly send emails to multiple contacts at once to deliver orders at their addresses as
                        opposed to filling forms multiple times that gets tedious even with autofill. Furthermore the
                        user generally doesn't have address and names of others saved in their autofill so having a
                        Contact drawer to directly make all this happen is a game changer. For us retailers not on our
                        Stone Management system have been proven to get onboarded 70% faster by this API which has
                        potential to help million dollar businesses by reducing times.

                        make the motion blur css-wg draft. If this gets made, I will contribute in its development,
                        guess I will be father of motion blur if that happens. And a big thanks to Adam Argyle for
                        supporting this draft, he's the CSS DevRel at Google and a really great communication as he's

                        a big name in the world of technological automation. Now he's sending a rover with his name to
                        the moon, and andreu has 8 satellites in space. And I was sitting with nothing, maybe I should

                    <p>I became a graphic design volunteer for the biggest pokémon community. I also acted as a UXE
                        making a lot of amazing tools to ease the work of other designers, and taught them development
                        too! I love pokémon and
                        designing gave me an edge over other developers, having an eye for a design is very important
                        for frontend.</p>
