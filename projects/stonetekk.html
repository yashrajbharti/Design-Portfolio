        <h2 id="main" class="projects">- brief -</h2>
        <p>StoneTEKK aims to modernize the traditionally disorganized stone industry. The
            project includes a real-time inventory management system, an e-commerce platform for purchasing stone
            online, and an AR experience for visualizing stone in 3D on walls or floors. It also features an advanced
            calculator for pricing stone defects.
        </p>
        <h2 class="projects">- context -</h2>
        <p>The stone industry often relies on paper-based systems and lacks digital solutions for managing inventory and
            sales. StoneTEKK was developed to address these inefficiencies by integrating technology into every aspect
            of the industry, from inventory management to customer purchasing experiences.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- problem statement -</h2>
        <p>The traditional stone industry suffers from disorganization and inefficiencies. There is a need for a modern
            system to manage inventory, provide an online purchasing solution, and offer tools for dealing with defects
            and pricing adjustments.
        </p>
        <h2 class="projects">- quick glance for hiring managers -</h2>
        <p>
            As the UX Lead for StoneTEKK, I led the design and development of a transformative management system for the
            stone industry, addressing inefficiencies in a paper-reliant sector. The platform integrated real-time
            inventory management, an e-commerce solution, and AR-based 3D visualization for stone layouts.
            <br><br>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Stakeholder Collaboration:</b> Partnered with a stone company owner to understand industry workflows
                like batch management and defect handling, aligning the design with real-world needs.
            </li>
            <li><b>Innovative Features:</b> Designed solutions such as a defect-pricing calculator and gamified progress
                indicators, leveraging the Zeigarnik Effect to enhance user engagement.
            </li>
            <li><b>Iterative Design:</b> Conducted user testing to refine the experience, ensuring usability and
                functionality
                tailored to business goals. We faced challenges with making the right design that feels seamless to the
                workers
                with their limited technical knowledge, and CUJ efforts were crucial. We finally achieved an intuitive,
                easy-to-use
                solution.
            </li>
            <li><b>Cross-Functional Leadership:</b> Collaborated with designers, developers, and marketers to deliver a
                cohesive, user-centric platform.

            <li>To modernize the stone industry with a digital solution that integrates inventory management,

            <li>To offer a more engaging and satisfying user experience through gamification and

        </ul>

        <h2 class="projects">- research -</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Personas:</b> Developed personas for stone industry professionals, buyers, and homeowners looking to
                purchase stone.</li>
            <li><b>Target Audience:</b> Stone industry businesses, contractors, and end customers.</li>
            <li><b>Analysis:</b> Research highlighted the need for streamlined inventory management and engaging online
                purchasing experiences. The Zeigarnik Effect was identified as a key
                factor in enhancing user engagement.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="projects">- case study: zeigarneik effect -</h2>
        <p class="content">In our research and testing, we found that users preferred having an indication of the number
            of steps
            required to order a stone. We implemented a step-by-step guide showing the stages: adding to cart, adding
            address, adding payment, and swiping to pay, labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4. Upon completing the process, we added a
            celebration confetti animation for a successful order. This feature was well-received and loved by users.
            <br><br>
            The <b>Zeigarnik Effect</b>, a psychological phenomenon where people remember uncompleted or interrupted
            tasks
            better than completed ones, can be leveraged in UX design to enhance user engagement and completion rates.
            By showing users the steps required to complete their order, we tap into the Zeigarnik Effect, keeping them
            motivated to continue through each step until completion. If a person leaves the process mid-way, they are
            constantly reminded of their incomplete steps when they return to browse more stones, driving their desire
            to complete the task. The visual progress indicators and the final celebration confetti act as incentives,
            reducing the likelihood of task abandonment and ensuring a more satisfying user experience.
            <br> <br>This strategic
            use of the Zeigarnik Effect in our design directly contributed to the positive feedback and increased user
            satisfaction in our case study. Users particularly loved the <b>gamification</b> aspect, where the confetti
            celebration provided a rewarding sense of achievement upon completing their purchase.

                monthly recurring orders at multiple addresses. The entire process was documented and can be found
