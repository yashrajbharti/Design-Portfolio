        <h2 id="main">- brief -</h2>
        <p>Kandi Kosmos is a social media app designed for the kandi festival culture, where
            beads (kandi) are exchanged and collected. The app allows users to scan QR codes on beads to view
            information, add social media posts, and track the beads' geographical journey. It also enables users to see
            previous owners' posts associated with each bead.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- context -</h2>
        <p>The kandi festival is a traditional event involving the exchange of decorative beads. Kandi Kosmos aims to
            modernize and enhance this experience by integrating technology, allowing users to track and interact with
            beads digitally.</p>

        <h2 class="projects">- problem statement -</h2>
        <p>The traditional kandi festival lacks a digital component that connects participants and tracks the history of
            beads. There is a need for a platform that bridges the gap between tradition and technology, enhancing the
            festival experience and connecting people globally.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- quick glance for hiring managers -</h2>

        <img loading="lazy" class="kit design" src="../images/KandiKosmos/Design System.jpg" alt="">
        <p>To ensure a seamless and cohesive design process, we adopted the Flowbite design system. This system provided
            numerous benefits:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Consistency:</b> Flowbite ensured a uniform look and feel across the app, enhancing the user
                experience.
            </li>
            <li><b>Efficiency:</b> The pre-defined components and styles accelerated the design process, allowing us to
                focus
                more on innovation.</li>
            <li><b>Scalability:</b> The modular nature of Flowbite made it easy to scale the app's design as new
                features were
                added.</li>
        </ul>

            - random color kandi generator -
        </h2>
        <p>To facilitate both design and development, I created a Figma plugin and a web component for generating random
            color kandi. This tool allowed designers to quickly prototype with diverse bead colors and patterns,
            ensuring that the visual design was vibrant and engaging. Developers could seamlessly integrate these
            designs into the app, maintaining consistency and speeding up the development process.</p>

        <h2 class="projects">- iterations -</h2>
        <p>Iterated on designs based on user feedback and testing. Refined the scanning process and enabled scanning
            options to see post without login (Guest mode), social media features (Edit, Report, etc), and geographical
            tracking (GPS location opt-in) to improve
            functionality and user experience.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- sketches and wireframes -</h2>
        <p>Created initial sketches and wireframes focusing on the user flow from scanning beads to viewing their
            history and adding posts. Emphasized a vibrant, engaging design consistent with the kandi festival's
            aesthetic.</p>

        <h2 class="projects">- usability testing -</h2>
        <p>Conducted usability tests to ensure the app met user needs and expectations. Tested features such as QR code
            scanning (that didn't work correctly before in Guest mode), bead visualization (that also had problems for
            non signed in users), and geographical tracking (where we faced Cesium Globe not showing in some old devices
            because of a bug in their codebase and had to tweak atmosphere in the viewer to make in work) to gather
            feedback and make improvements.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">
            - design pages and interactive earth -
        </h2>
        <p>Our design pages showcase the user journey, from scanning a bead to viewing its history and adding new posts.
            To visually represent the geographical journey of each bead, we integrated the Cesium globe into the app.
            This interactive map displays markers for posts associated with each kandi bead, highlighting the global
            connectivity of posts shown via Kandi Kosmos.</p>
