    <section>
        <h2 id="main" class="projects">- brief -</h2>
        <p> Redefining what's possible with Augmented Reality (AR) by providing immersive
            and straightforward AR and 3D experiences across 12 verticals.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- context -</h2>
        <p>ARtekk is a project designed to revolutionize the way users interact with various products using AR. It
            includes 12 verticals, such as lens, clothes, footwear, caps, makeup, jewelry, furniture, watches, cars,
            newspapers, and billboards, allowing users to explore and engage with products in a dynamic and engaging
            way.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- problem statement -</h2>
        <p>There was a need for a more engaging and interactive way for users to experience products, particularly in
            retail and public spaces, where traditional methods lacked the immersive and personalized experience that AR
            can provide.</p>

        <h2 class="projects glance">- quick glance for hiring managers -</h2>
        <p>

            <li><b>Testing & Optimization:</b> Led A/B testing for onboarding and UI, refining user flows for
                simplicity.</li>
            <li><b>User Validation:</b> Conducted in-person user testing in malls, where women and girls loved the

        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 class="projects">- crafted solution -</h2>
        <p>ARtekk offers a seamless AR experience that allows users to virtually try on and interact with products. The
            solution includes AR mirrors in public spots, such as in front of stores, where users can try on clothes,
            shoes, and other items in a virtual environment. This experience is further enhanced by the ability to
            capture pictures and videos within the AR setting. We also offer B2B solutions where our vanilla built web
            components can be used by any other platform regardless of their framework, for example we can provide AR
            makeup tools for cosmetic companies, embedded into their existing website.

        <h2 class="projects">- project goals -</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide an easy-to-use, immersive AR experience for users.</li>
            <li>Increase customer engagement by offering virtual try-ons and interactive product
                displays.</li>
            <li>Develop a scalable AR solution that can be applied across multiple verticals.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2 class="projects">- research -</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Personas:</b> Developed 8 personas, focusing on different types of shoppers—tech-savvy users,
                traditional shoppers, users with accessibility needs (e.g., those with vision impairments or motor skill
                challenges), and early adopters of AR technology.</li>
            <li><b>Target Audience:</b> Shoppers, especially those interested in fashion, tech, and luxury items, as
                well as brands looking to innovate in their customer engagement strategies.</li>
            <li><b>Analysis:</b> Surveyed users to gauge interest in AR try-ons, comfort level with using AR in public,
                and preferences for interactive shopping experiences. Found that while interest in AR was high, there
                were concerns about privacy and ease of use.</li>

                like photo and video capture within the AR environment. This solution was chosen for its broad appeal
                and potential to drive engagement.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="projects">- iterations -</h2>
        <p>Iterated on the onboarding process, reducing steps to make the AR experience more accessible. Conducted A/B
            testing to refine UI elements, ensuring that users could easily navigate and engage with the AR features.
        </p>
        <h2 class="projects">- sketches and wireframes -</h2>
        <p>Created initial sketches on pen and paper, focusing on user flow and interaction points. These were
            translated into wireframes, which were then iterated upon with input from the design team.</p>

        <h2 class="projects">- user and usability testing -</h2>
        <p>Conducted user testing in public spaces where the AR mirrors were deployed. Gathered feedback on the ease of
            use, effectiveness of the try-on experience, and overall satisfaction. Made adjustments based on this
            feedback, such as improving the accuracy of the AR overlays and simplifying the interface.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- conclusion -</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Challenges:</b> One of the main challenges was ensuring that the AR experience was accessible and
                easy to use for a broad audience, including those who were unfamiliar with AR technology.</li>
            <li><b>Learnings:</b> Learned the importance of user-centered design, especially in emerging technologies
                like AR. The project reinforced the need to balance innovation with usability.</li>
            <li><b>Outcomes:</b> Successfully developed a scalable AR solution that enhanced customer engagement and
                provided valuable insights for future AR projects.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="projects">- scope of improvements -</h2>
        <p>Future improvements could include integrating more advanced AR features, such as AI-driven customization
            options and further refinement of the AR overlays to improve realism.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- what could have been better -</h2>
        <p>The onboarding process could be further streamlined, and additional user manuals could be provided, apart
            from the docs in the website, to help users understand how to make the most of the AR features.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- final feedback and suggestions -</h2>
        <p>We'd like to ask users for feedback on their experience with ARtekk, especially focusing on how comfortable
            they felt using the AR features in public spaces and what additional features they would like to see.</p>
