            Wrkble: Online e-learning platform to get you <span class="brand">career</span> ready
        </h1>
    </main>
    <section>
        <h2 id="main" class="projects">- brief -</h2>
        <p>Wrkble is an e-learning platform that emphasizes hands-on experience by
            providing students with real projects on GitHub. This unique approach ensures that users gain practical
            skills directly applicable to advancing their careers.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- context -</h2>
        <p>Wrkble was developed to address the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the job market.
            Many e-learning platforms offer courses but lack the opportunity for students to apply what they've learned
            in real-world scenarios. Wrkble aims to bridge this gap by providing real projects and challenges that
            mirror industry needs.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- problem statement -</h2>
        <p>The traditional e-learning approach often leaves students without the practical experience required to be
            job-ready. Wrkble's challenge was to create a platform where users could apply their knowledge in real-world
            scenarios, thereby gaining relevant experience that would make them more attractive to employers.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- crafted solution -</h2>
        <p>Wrkble offers a unique learning experience by integrating real-world projects into the curriculum. Students
            tackle actual problems in tech, hosted on GitHub, which provides them with hands-on experience. This
            practical approach prepares them for real job challenges, making them career-ready upon completion of the
            courses.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Wrkble underwent a significant redesign to enhance its usability and user experience. The usability study
                conducted involved observing user interactions with the platform to identify critical issues and areas
                for improvement.</p>
            <h3>Usability Study Overview</h3>
            <p>Mode of Conduct: Physical presence, no screen captures, HCI principles</p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Breadcrumb Navigation: Users found breadcrumbs effective for navigation, aligning with common web
                    usage patterns seen on sites like Amazon. This supports Jacob's Law that users prefer familiar
                    interface designs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Clickable Elements: Users initially missed clickable elements such as the cart button due to its
                    lack of visual distinction. Enhancements like subtle animations were recommended.
                </li>
                <li>Emotional Contagion: Users desired a more human-centric design on the landing page to foster empathy
                    and connection.
                </li>
                <li>Contrast and Accessibility: Tags had a high contrast ratio of 8.1, making non-clickable elements
                    visually prominent. Adjusting the contrast ratio to 4.5 was suggested for better usability.</li>
                <li>Search Functionality: Users comfortably utilized the search bar, although minor issues were noted on
                    iOS devices, highlighting the need for further testing on different platforms.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Recommendations and Changes</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Redesign of the Single Course Page: Simplified layout with breadcrumbs placed at the top for
                    intuitive navigation.
                </li>
                <li>Redesign of Instructor card: Instructors' cards made visually and functionally interactive to align
                    with user expectations.</li>
                <li>Clickable Wishlist and Cart Items: Entire components made clickable to enhance user interaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improved Iconography: Redesigned icons for better clarity and user understanding.
                </li>
                <li>Action Prompts for Tags: Added prompts when difficulty tags are clicked to guide user actions.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The usability improvements resulted in a dramatic 500% increase in course sales. The redesign made Wrkble
                more intuitive, accessible, and user-friendly, directly contributing to higher user engagement and
                satisfaction.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="projects"> - normalcy bias -</h2>
        <p>Normalcy bias refers to how people expect things to work based on their past experiences, which may not
            always align with reality. For example, users might expect their camera's flash to activate automatically at
            night, not considering that a low battery could prevent this. We observed normalcy bias in Wrkble and
            addressed it by implementing an offline and online event listener. This feature checks if the user or admin
            is offline, ensuring that important course edits and submissions are not missed. We added a spinning offline
            animation to indicate the system is trying to reconnect and a 1-second check symbol to show the user is back
            online. This approach helps manage user expectations and maintain a seamless experience.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b> Try Going offline and see what happens!</b></p>

        <h2 class="projects"> - new design -</h2>
        <p>The final design focused on clarity, engagement, and practicality. It included features like breadcrumb
            navigation, clickable elements, and a more human-centric design on the landing page to foster empathy and
            connection.</p>

        <h2 class="projects">- conclusion -</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Challenges:</b> Addressing normalcy bias in users who expected certain functionalities to work in
                specific ways, improving accessibility, and making the platform more intuitive.</li>
            <li><b>Learnings:</b> Identified the importance of user-centric design and the need for continuous iteration
                based on user feedback.</li>
            <li><b>Outcomes:</b> Usability improvements resulted in a 500% increase in course sales, demonstrating the
                effectiveness of the redesign.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="projects">- scope of improvements -</h2>
        <p>Future developments include integrating a resume builder and a recruiter connection feature. These are in the
            research phase and aim to further bridge the gap between education and employment.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- what could have been better -</h2>
        <p>The initial launch could have included more comprehensive user testing across different devices, particularly
            iOS, to catch platform-specific issues earlier in the process.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- final feedback and suggestions -</h2>
        <p>The usability report provided actionable insights, such as the need for better iconography and more intuitive
            navigation. These improvements were implemented in the final design, resulting in a more user-friendly
            platform.</p>
