        <p>Wrkble is an e-learning platform dedicated to making users job-ready. Unlike other platforms, Wrkble provides
            real projects on GitHub, allowing students to tackle real-world problems in tech. This hands-on approach
            ensures that the skills earned are practical and directly applicable to advancing their careers. By working
            on actual projects and solving real issues, students gain valuable experience that truly prepares them for
            the job market.</p>
        <h2 class="projects">- research and future development -</h2>
        <p>We are currently researching new features to enhance Wrkble's offerings. Our goal is to connect with
            recruiters and companies to send them resumes of our top students. Upon completion of certain skills, we
            provide a complementary resume builder and add the student's name and resume to our database. This allows
            companies to reach out to highly skilled students directly. These features are in the research phase, but
            they represent our commitment to bridging the gap between education and employment.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Wrkble underwent a significant redesign to enhance its usability and user experience. The usability study
                conducted involved observing user interactions with the platform to identify critical issues and areas
                for improvement.</p>
            <h3>Usability Study Overview</h3>
            <p>Mode of Conduct: Physical presence, no screen captures, HCI principles</p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Breadcrumb Navigation: Users found breadcrumbs effective for navigation, aligning with common web
                    usage patterns seen on sites like Amazon. This supports Jacob's Law that users prefer familiar
                    interface designs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Clickable Elements: Users initially missed clickable elements such as the cart button due to its
                    lack of visual distinction. Enhancements like subtle animations were recommended.
                </li>
                <li>Emotional Contagion: Users desired a more human-centric design on the landing page to foster empathy
                    and connection.
                </li>
                <li>Contrast and Accessibility: Tags had a high contrast ratio of 8.1, making non-clickable elements
                    visually prominent. Adjusting the contrast ratio to 4.5 was suggested for better usability.</li>
                <li>Search Functionality: Users comfortably utilized the search bar, although minor issues were noted on
                    iOS devices, highlighting the need for further testing on different platforms.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Recommendations and Changes</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Redesign of the Single Course Page: Simplified layout with breadcrumbs placed at the top for
                    intuitive navigation.
                </li>
                <li>Redesign of Instructor card: Instructors' cards made visually and functionally interactive to align
                    with user expectations.</li>
                <li>Clickable Wishlist and Cart Items: Entire components made clickable to enhance user interaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improved Iconography: Redesigned icons for better clarity and user understanding.
                </li>
                <li>Action Prompts for Tags: Added prompts when difficulty tags are clicked to guide user actions.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The usability improvements resulted in a dramatic 500% increase in course sales. The redesign made Wrkble
                more intuitive, accessible, and user-friendly, directly contributing to higher user engagement and
                satisfaction.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="projects"> - normalcy bias -</h2>
        <p>Normalcy bias refers to how people expect things to work based on their past experiences, which may not
            always align with reality. For example, users might expect their camera's flash to activate automatically at
            night, not considering that a low battery could prevent this. We observed normalcy bias in Wrkble and
            addressed it by implementing an offline and online event listener. This feature checks if the user or admin
            is offline, ensuring that important course edits and submissions are not missed. We added a spinning offline
            animation to indicate the system is trying to reconnect and a 1-second check symbol to show the user is back
            online. This approach helps manage user expectations and maintain a seamless experience.</p>
